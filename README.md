# employee-management
 
Our application aims to provide a simple way of user management in a enterprise. The system handles three types of users Employee, HR and Admin. Each user has a specific subset of features they have been granted acess to. Each user role dictates what data they can access in the system. Each user is assigned a "Role" upon signing up on the application. Based on user's role, the user lands in a different dashboard. This serves as a way of abstracting the capabilities of the system that may not be of significance to the user's role in the enterprise. The system has data models such as user, projects, remarks and appraisals. The creation and deletion of data is under these models and is abstracted by the role of the user.
